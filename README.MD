ELLBOX is a Lagrangian Particle Simulation code to track the movement of ellipsoidal particles in a cubical box. 

The ellipsoidal particles can collide with each other and the walls.

The linear motion is computed using a simple forward-Euler scheme.

The rotational motion is computed using the Euler equation of rotational motion using an RK4 scheme.

The orientation of the ellipsoids are tracked using Quaternions.
